## go-bitdotio

Very early work-in-progress on a Go SDK for bit.io. Many TODO's are noted 
throughout the code. At a high-level, major TODO's include:
- Handling HTTP request/wrapper methods with optional body keys
- API Import/Export
- Query Endpoint
- Postgres connections/pooling
- Tests
- Real logging
- Organizing as a proper Go module

Testing is not set up yet, `main.go` demonstrates the initial progress.
